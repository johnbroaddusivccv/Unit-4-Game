# Unit-4-Game
This project is a game in which you click on crystals and try to exactly match the random number generated with the sum received from clicking on crystals.
This project may or may not be useful to someone who is trying to change the way that they think.
Users can start the project by launching the link and hovering the cursor over the crystal images.
If users are forking my project and making there own renditions I recieved alot of help from youtube channels // I was confused as to how to make jQuery work in this project and I stumbled across a video where a woman put the javascript link in the header a different way then everyone else had.  Previous users were using npm cdn and bower.  I was not not aware of the right thing to do at the time so I just went with whatever works.
I am the only one maintaining and contributing to this project for the time being. I am going to ask for input from my classmates at the University of Texas Austin so I am sure that counts as some form of contribution in the long run.
